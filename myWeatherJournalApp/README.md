# Weather-Journal App Project

## Instructions

This is my Second Project which I used everything I have learned till now, I used CSS and Js to make my Static page looks life " dynamic ", I try my best to make the Project look Simple as much as I can , and :hover is my favorite selector I kinda use it a lot , I wish the Project look nice after all.


## The Markup Languages I used :
- HTML
- CSS

## The Programming Languages I used :

- JavaScript

## Libraries I used :
- Google Fonts


## Summarization :
- This is a single-page app that takes
Your zip code and
how Do you feel ?
Then stores it, and displays it along with your feeling and the weather at the time and date of entry.

## Note :
- I used the "commentsOnlyJS " Files this time, and I reviewed the lessons and then wrote the code from scratch, previously I was stuck on some codes so I search on google for getting solutions but this time I already found the solutions inside the Lessons,
I am sorry about the first time and right now I am trying to do the Project using " Object " but I am facing a lot of problems so I have done the project Using " Array " it easier and the instructor already explain the Demo Animal Project using Array,
So right now I submit this project while I am looking for a way to do it using " Object " not just " Array ".
Thank you again and I am sorry for the Pervious one.
